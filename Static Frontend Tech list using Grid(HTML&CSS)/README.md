# Static Frontend Tech list using Grid(HTML&CSS)

I have created this responsive project to checkout out the Grid Layout of most popular Frontend Technologies:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React JS
5. Angular JS

This site is fully responsive with containing the hovering and transition effect on technology's Icon and Get Started button.
I used linear-gradient in first card, all the technology icons and Get Started button.
Cards are fitted into the screen using Grid layout.

    <h2>What is T-20 Cricket ?</h2>
    <p>
      Twenty20 (T20) is a shortened game format of cricket. At the professional
      level, it was introduced by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in
      2003 for the inter-county competition.[1] In a Twenty20 game, the two
      teams have a single innings each, which is restricted to a maximum of 20
      overs. Together with first-class and List A cricket, Twenty20 is one of
      the three current forms of cricket recognised by the International Cricket
      Council (ICC) as being at the highest international or domestic level. A
      typical Twenty20 game is completed in about three hours, with each innings
      lasting around 90 minutes and an official 10-minute break between the
      innings. This is much shorter than previous forms of the game, and is
      closer to the timespan of other popular team sports. It was introduced to
      create a fast-paced game that would be attractive to spectators at the
      ground and viewers on television. The game has succeeded in spreading
      around the cricket world. On most international tours there is at least
      one Twenty20 match and all Test-playing nations have a domestic cup
      competition. West Indies are currently the defending world champions,
      after winning the 2016 World Cup.England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in

    <h2>Why T-20 ?</h2>
    <p>
      Twenty20 cricket is claimed to have resulted in a more athletic and
      explosive form of cricket. Indian fitness coach Ramji Srinivasan declared
      in an interview with the Indian fitness website Takath.com that Twenty20
      had "raised the bar" in terms of fitness levels for all players, demanding
      higher levels of strength, speed, agility and reaction time from all
      players regardless of role in the team.[27] Matthew Hayden credited
      retirement from international cricket with aiding his England and Wales
      Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for the inter-county competition.[1] In a
      Twenty20 game, the two teams have a single innings each, which is
      restricted to a maximum of 20 overs. Together with first-class and List A

      confirmed that this tournament had been postponed, due to the COVID-19
      pandemic.[12][13][14] In August 2020, the ICC confirmed that India would
      host the 2021 tournament England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) in 2003 for
